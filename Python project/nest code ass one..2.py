#write a program to task the lenght and width of a room as input and calculate the area..
#user will enter the lenght and width of the room and the result area should be printed in the output
#the input values of lenght and width can be decimal values.So, output area should also be in decimal point
#assume the user will always enter positive values..
lenght = float(input("Enter the Lenght of the room: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the room: "))
Area = lenght * width
print("Area of the room is ", Area )
